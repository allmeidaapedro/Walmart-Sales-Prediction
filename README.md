# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
This is a machine learning project using LightGBM to predict Walmart weekly sales. It is a supervised learning regression task. Predicting sales will offer numerous benefits and useful applications for Walmart, such as inventory management, resource allocation, supply chain efficiency, promotion and pricing strategies, financial planning, competitive advantage, customer satisfaction and waste reduction.

# Business problem

<b>Predict Walmart sales</b>

<b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
- One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays which impact sales on each day. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock some times. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.

<b>What is sales prediction?</b>
- Sales prediction is the process of using historical data and market trends to forecast future sales performance.

<b>Why would a retail store like Walmart want to predict sales?</b><br>
1. Inventory Management
2. Resource Allocation
3. Supply Chain Efficiency
4. Promotion and Pricing Strategies
5. Financial Planning
6. Competitive Advantage
7. Customer Satisfaction
8. Waste Reduction

# The following pipeline was used

<b>1. Define the business problem.</b><br>
<b>2. Collect the data and get a general overview of it.</b><br>
<b>3. Split the data into train and test sets.</b><br>
<b>4. Explore the data (exploratory data analysis).</b><br>
<b>5. Data cleaning and preprocessing.</b><br>
<b>6. Model training, comparison, selection and tuning.</b><br>
<b>7. Final production model testing and evaluation.</b><br>
<b>8. Conclude and interpret the model results.</b><br>

<b>Each step is approached in detail inside the project.</b>

# Technologies used

Python packages such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Math and Random. Furthermore, packages like skopt and lightgbm were also used. I explored statistical visualization, modelling, data manipulation, cleaning and preprocessing using them.

# Run this project on your local machine

In order to run this project on your local machine, download the dataset in kaggle link at the end of this readme file or the csv file directly. Then, download the ipynb file "Walmart sales prediction". Both the csv and ipynb files are in this repository. Now, you just have to put the dataset in the same directory of your running platform (Jupyter, vscode, etc.) and run the ipynb file there. Finally, make sure the csv file downloaded from kaggle or repository is named "Walmart.csv".
